# Terraform AWS Bastion Host Architecture
## Overview

this project automates the deployment of a secure bastion host structure on AWS. This infrastructure allows for a highly controlled and monitored access point to your private instances, enhancing the security of your AWS environment.

## Features

- **Secure Access**: Utilize bastion hosts for secure access to private instances.
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Enhance security by monitoring and controlling access through a central point.
- **Automated Deployment**: Simplify the deployment process with Terraform.

## Tech Stack

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for automating infrastructure deployment.
- **AWS**: Cloud platform for hosting the bastion host architecture.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- **Terraform**: [Download and Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- **AWS CLI**: [Install and Configure AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-bastion.git
    cd terraform-aws-bastion
    ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Review the deployment plan:**

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4. **Apply the Terraform configuration:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the changes by typing `yes` and pressing Enter.

5. **Access the Bastion Hosts:**

    After completion, Terraform will display the public IP addresses of the bastion hosts. Use these addresses for secure access to your private instances.

## Cleanup

To destroy the created resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` and pressing Enter.
